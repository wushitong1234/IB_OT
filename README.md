# Optimal Transport for Information Bottleneck
A framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) with posterior probability for the computation of Information Bottleneck (IB) problem.

The Generalized Alternating Sinkhorn (GAS) algorithm is presented in "Information Bottleneck Revisited: Posterior Probability Perspective with Optimal Transport" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10206826
